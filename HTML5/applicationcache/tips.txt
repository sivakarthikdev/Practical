HTML5 introduces application cache, which means that a web application is cached, and accessible without an internet connection.

Application cache gives an application three advantages:
	Offline browsing - users can use the application when they're offline
	Speed - cached resources load faster
	Reduced server load - the browser will only download updated/changed resources from the server
