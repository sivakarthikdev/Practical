* REST is an architectural style for designing distributed systems. 
* It is not a standard but a set of constraints, such as being stateless, having a client/server relationship, and a uniform interface. 
* REST is not strictly related to HTTP, but it is most commonly associated with it.

Principles of REST
	* Resources expose easily understood directory structure URIs.
	* Representations transfer JSON or XML to represent data objects and attributes.
	* Messages use HTTP methods explicitly (for example, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE).
	* Stateless interactions store no client context on the server between requests. 
	  State dependencies limit and restrict scalability. The client holds session state.
