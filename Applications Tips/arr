Script add
	Old examples may have type="text/javascript" in the <script> tag. This is no longer required. JavaScript is the default scripting language in all modern browsers and in HTML5
	script End of body tage -- > This is to avoid blocking html rendering while dowloading scripts what improves site responsiveness

Javascirpt variable
	Variable names must begin with a letter
	Variable names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it)
	Variable names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
	Both JavaScript statements and JavaScript variables are case-sensitive

Javascript has dynamic datatypes,This means same variable we can use different data types

Array :
	condensed Array
		var cars=new Array("Saab","Volvo","BMW");
	literal Array
		var cars=["Saab","Volvo","BMW"];

With JavaScript all variables can be objects

Object --> Objects are just data, with properties and methods.
	Properties are values associated with objects.
	Methods are actions that objects can perform

In object oriented languages, properties and methods are often called object members

It is common, in object oriented languages, to use camel-case names.You will often see names like someMethod(),instead of some_method().

return
	Sometimes you want your function to return a value back to where the call was made.
	This is possible by using the return statement.
	When using the return statement, the function will stop executing, and return the specified value.
	The return statement is also used when you simply want to exit a function. The return value is optional

Variable
	lifetime of variables:
		Local variables are deleted as soon as the function is completed
		Global variables are deleted when you close the page.

+ operator
	If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

break --> The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
continue --> The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop

Javascript is prototype based language not class based 

What do you understand by this keyword in JavaScript? 
	Ans: In JavaScript the this is a context-pointer and not an object pointer. It gives you the top-most context that is placed on the stack. The following gives two different results (in the browser, where by-default the window object is the 0-level context):

Knockout JS
	Server side access


'' == '0' // false
0 == '' // true
0 == '0' // true
false == 'false' // false
false == '0' // true
false == undefined // false
false == null // false
null == undefined // true
Number(“Hello world!”); //NaN
Number(“”); //0
Number(“000010”); //10
Number(true); //1
Number(NaN); //NaN


var myfunc = function() {} defines a variable that references an anonymous function.
function myfunc() {} defines a named function "myfunc"


What will be the output of below statement?
alert(NaN == NaN);
Ans:it will show false
because NaN is not equal to any value, including NaN.


What is the HTML DOM?
DOM means Document Object Model.
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.	


Javascript Timing Events
	setInterval,setTimeout

When onLoad and onunload events are used in javascript?
	The onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
	The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the proper version of the web page based on the information.
	The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with cookies.
