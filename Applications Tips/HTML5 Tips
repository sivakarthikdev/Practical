Doctype 
	It’s used to tell validators and editors what tags and attributes you can use and how the document should be formed.
	It’s also used by a lot of web browsers to determine how the browser will render the page.
	A valid doctype often causes browsers to render pages sin “standards mode.”
	We want to use HTML5’s new elements, and that means we need to let browsers and validators know about the tags we’ll be using

	Different Types : Strict,Transitional,Frameset
		html & xhtml 

Why use XHTML structure
	Most web servers serve HTML pages with the text/html MIME type because of Internet Explorer’s inability to properly handle the application/xml+xhtml MIME type associated with XHTML pages. 
	Because of this, browsers tend to strip off self-closing tags because self-closing tags were not considered valid HTML before HTML5. For example, if you had a self-closing script tag above a div like this:
	<script language="javascript" src="application.js" /></script>
	<h2>Help</h2>
	the browser would remove the self-closing forward slash, and then the renderer would think that the h2 was within the script tag, which never closes! This is why you see script tags coded with an explicit closing tag, even though a self-closing tag is vali d XHTML markup.
	So, be aware of possible issues like this if you do use selfclosing tags in your HTML5 documents, because they will be served with the text/html MIME type. You can learn more about this issue and others at http://www.webdevout.net/articles/beware-of-xhtml#myths.s

HTML5 advanced
	Webstorage
	Web Sql Database
	Web Socket

	Webstorage(Either using localstorage or sessionstorage) & WebSQLDatabase stroage -- Store data on client

	LocalStorage --> store data in key/value pairs,tied to a domain	and persists across the browser session (C,F,IE8,S,IOS,Android)

	SessionStorage --> Store data in key/value pairs,tied to a domain and it's erased when browser session end (C,F,IE8,S,IOS,Android)

	Web SQL Database --> fully Releation database Support for creating Table ,Insert,uodate,delete and select with transaction,tied to a domain persists across session (C,F,IE8,S,IOS,Android2)

	Offline web application --> Define filles to be cached for offline use,allowing application run to without internet connection (C,F,IE8,S,IOS,Android2)


Html5 Sematics Element
	sematics -- meaning

		header,nav,section,article,aside,figcaption,figure,footer
	


File API
	syntex : 
		<input type="file" multiple id="files" />
		var file = document.getElementId('files');
		file.files[0].name,file.files[0].size

	A change event is dispatched to the <input> when files are selected 

	Available Meta Data
		.name -- > Just the file name not the path
		.size --> file size in bytes
		.lastmodifieddate --> as Date object
		.type --> a media type like "text/plain" or "image/jpeg" 
	
	Reading File
		To read the contents,creare the FileReader object-async
		Add a load event listener to it for when it's done
		call a read method on the FileReader passing the file

			* Reading the data into plain string,we can get a data url
			* Allows us to load a fileand use it on <img src>,<audio src>,background-img

				Reading the URL --> readAsDataURL

	Reading a File as Bytes
		we can also read a file as an array of bytes
		FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer() will produce an ArrayBuffer
